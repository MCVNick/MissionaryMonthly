                This whole adventure started when our family had a loved one 
                on an LDS mission. We wanted to send care packages to remind 
                him that he was thought of, but we struggled with things to 
                add to the box each time. After coming up with a theme, 
                filling them became easier and we started sending them more 
                consistently. He loved opening boxes and looked forward to 
                the new theme with each box.
            </p>

                Now we would like to help your family send love from back 
                home with our themed monthly ideas.
